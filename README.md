+Original description: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Execution and files
+The Data Set has been stored in "Getting & Cleaning Data/Course Project".

+The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.

+The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work. 

+The result of the execution is that a "dataset2.txt" file is being created, 
that stores the data (mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity&subject).
