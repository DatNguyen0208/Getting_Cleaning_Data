<<<<<<< HEAD

Introduction

This repository is hosting the R code for the assignment of the DataScience track's "Getting and Cleaning Data" course which will be peer assessed.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the collection, work with, and cleaning of this data set. Tidy data have been prepared so can be used for later analysis.

Data 
Source of the original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
Original description: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Execution and files
The Data Set has been stored in "Getting & Cleaning Data/Course Project".
The CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the work that has been performed to clean up the data.
The run_analysis.R is the script that has been used for this work. 
The result of the execution is that a dataset2.txt file is being created, that stores the data (mean and standard deviation of each measurement per activity&subject).
